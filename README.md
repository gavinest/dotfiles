## dotfiles management

I use [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage my dotfiles. Check out the [blog post](https://estenssorog.com/posts/easy-dotfile-management-with-chezmoi/) I wrote about it.

## vim

vim plugin manager: [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

The `.vim/plugged/` directory is `.gitignore`d to avoid version controlling plugin repositories.

Install plugins by acitvating vim and running `:PlugInstall`
